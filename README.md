# ESP32-IDF-Learning-ADC-Basics
Learning the basics of ESP32 ADC in IDF framework. Includes heavily commented version of Espressif's examples found at https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v3.1-beta1. Alongside a screenshot of sample readings


Created using NodeMCU-32s 
Example code without my added comments can be found at: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v3.1-beta1/examples/peripherals/adc/main/adc1_example_main.c
This work was done in VScode with PlatformIO.
Finally, the testing was done by use of an AD2, and the screenshot of results shows the AD2 software; Waveforms, displaying the voltage currently being inputted to GPIO pin 34 as that is the pin configured in main.c file.
